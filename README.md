# horiseon-code-refactor

# Fixing the Horiseon webpage code and streamlining its elements and style sheet. 

## Description 

What I have done in this project:

- Changed most non-semantic HTML elements to more appropriate semantic HTML elements
- HTML elements have been used following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title. 

In order so that:

- The Horiseon webpage is optimized for search engines
- The codebase follows accessibility standards

This challenge was an exciting way to show off what I've learnt so far in this bootcamp, and an opportunity to work with other students to trouble shoot issues that we were having and learning and working through it together. I learnt that there are many ways to write code that will achieve the same outcome, however some ways are clearly more efficient and concise than others. After completing this project, I feel I have learnt a few ways to make my own style of coding more clear and efficient.
